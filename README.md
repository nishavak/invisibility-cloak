# Invisibility Cloak

Image processing using **OpenCV Python**

The code uses default camera to capture the video stream.

Your cloak need not be red; 'hue', 'saturation' and 'value' parameters of the masks can be altered to have cloaks of different colors!

The code execution can be stopped by pressing key _'q'_.
